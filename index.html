                    The importance of education in society has always been great as it is irrespective of caste, race,
                    gender, religion. Educated people are treated as equals on the basis of their knowledge and
                    competence. In addition to this, educated people are open-minded and are able to listen and accept
                    other people’s views regardless of the fact of how different they are. Education offers a
                    possibility to live independently and thus be free. It is our shelter against financial storms and
                    wrong decisions.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the key to turn a weakness into a strength. It offers
                different tools and ways to understand problems that lay ahead of us and helps resolve them. More
                importantly, education provides us with considerable mental agility to make the right decisions and
                spring into action when needed. Many types of research show that educated women can more easily stand up
                against gender bias and marital violence as they have improved their decision-making capabilities.

                Whether it is about respect, a higher position in society and a professional environment, financial
                security, family stability, education provides all of these and much more. Home stability provided by
                owning your own home helps children who grew up in their own houses or apartments become more
                successful. They are more likely to graduate high school (25%) and finish college (116%). “Education is
                the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world,” as Nelson Mandela said. It helps people
                become better citizens, get a better-paid job, shows the difference between good and bad. Education
                shows us the importance of hard work and, at the same time, helps us grow and develop. Thus, we are able
                to shape a better society to live in by knowing and respecting rights, laws, and regulations. Learning
                languages through educational processes helps interact with different people in order to exchange ideas,
                knowledge, good practices. It teaches us to live in harmony.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education has always secured respect from society. In order to ensure a
                comfortable lifestyle, people should educate themselves and obtain a well-paid job to be successful and
                satisfied. It helps gain a better reputation and increases the chances of climbing the career ladder
                more easily and faster. In turn, it provides financial resources for stable lives people can afford to
                buy their own house or apartment and thus secure their children's happiness and success. Furthermore,
                being able to own your own home provides stability and increases self-confidence. It leads to creating a
                positive environment for families and communities. “Children of homeowners are 116% more likely to
                graduate from college than children of renters of the same age, race, and income. They are also 25% more
                likely to graduate from high school and have higher math and reading scores, with fewer behavioral
                problems,” according to research at the University of Tennessee.</p>
